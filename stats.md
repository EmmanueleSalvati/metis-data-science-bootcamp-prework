## Statistics

Allen Downey wrote great short books to introduce statistics in a fun
way, going over examples and exercises using python. They are freely
available to boot.

Think Stats is a great book to both refresh/learn the most critical
statistics topics and gain experience in how you'd apply statistics
analysis to problems using python. It covers typical statistics topics
from a modern, simulation/coding based perspective. The chapters are
quite concise and easy to read.

You can download a PDF or read the book online
[here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/). Of course, if you
are so inclined, you can also buy a hard copy on Amazon, but that is
not necessary.

We will be focusing on the **first 9 chapters**. You can go through these chapters in 6 to 9 hours (depending on how
familiar you are with statistics and python) Please
do so. If it takes somewhat longer, that's fine. However, don't get
stuck too long on a single chapter. This preparation will help you a lot, and it will
provide a good initial exposure to using python for data analysis, but
it is not your only chance to internalize these topics. If at any
point you feel overwhelmed, don't worry. You don't need to master all
of this in prework.

5 of the 6 required exercises are also from this book. It would be a good idea to tackle these exercises as you work your way through the book. For example, the first exercise is 2.4 at the end of chapter 2. The best time to start working on it is after you read Chapter 2. 

If you can finish the required exercises with time to spend, we suggest working on some of the optional ones. These may take longer, but will definitely improve your skills and bootcamp experience. Take your time with these
exercises, don't rush them. Don't push yourself to finish any of them, if you're short on time. Even completing a single
of these is an excellent bonus.


### Think Bayes Chapters 1 & 2

Another important subject is the Bayesian approach to probability,
where _probability_ is approached as _the state of knowledge_ rather
than the _expected frequency_ of things. This Bayesian approach is
used in a lot of data science applications. Luckily, Downey used his
method in Think Stats to write another free introduction book on Bayes
with python-based examples and exercises. It is called Think Bayes and
you can find it [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/).

Please read the first two chapters of this book will work both as a
reinforcement of probabilities (covered by Think Stats as well) and an
introduction to the Bayesian framework.

The last required exercise is from Think Bayes, and two optional exercises are also Bayesian problems.
